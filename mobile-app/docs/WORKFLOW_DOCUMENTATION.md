## Customer Reliability System

### 1. Reliability Score Calculation

```
Reliability Score = 100 - (No-show Rate Ã— 2) - Cancellation Rate

Rating Levels:
- Excellent: 90-100%
- Good: 75-89%
- Fair: 60-74%
- Poor: <60%
```

### 2. Reliability Factors

- **Total Bookings**: Historical booking count
- **No-show Count**: Times customer didn't show up
- **Cancellation Count**: Times customer cancelled
- **Timing**: Late cancellations weighted more heavily

---

graph TD

    B --> C[Allow Free Weekend Bookings]
    B --> D[Accept Walk-ins Only]

# Bug Fixes Applied to Reservi Demo App

## üêõ Date Formatting Errors - RESOLVED

### Issue Description

Users were experiencing `TypeError: Cannot read property 'toLocaleDateString' of undefined` errors when:

1. Navigating to BookingConfirmed screen after completing a booking
2. Clicking "Cancel" on a booking in the CustomerBookings screen

### Root Cause

React Navigation serializes route parameters, converting Date objects to strings during navigation. The screens were expecting Date objects but receiving strings.

### Fixes Applied

#### 1. BookingConfirmed Screen Fix

**Problem**: `bookingDetails.date` was undefined or not a Date object
**Solution**:

- Updated `BookingScreen.tsx` to pass date as ISO string: `date: selectedDate.toISOString()`
- Updated `App.tsx` route parameters: `date: string` instead of `date: Date`
- Updated `BookingConfirmedScreen.tsx` to parse string back to Date: `new Date(bookingDetails.date)`

```typescript
// Before (causing error)
{bookingDetails.date.toLocaleDateString("en-US", {...})}

// After (working)
{bookingDetails.date
  ? new Date(bookingDetails.date).toLocaleDateString("en-US", {...})
  : "Date not available"}
```

#### 2. CancellationScreen Fix

**Problem**: Route parameters mismatch - expecting `bookingDateTime: Date` but receiving separate `date` and `time` strings
**Solution**:

- Updated CancellationScreen to use actual route parameters: `{bookingId, businessName, service, date, time, bookingFee}`
- Created Date object from strings: `const bookingDateTime = new Date(\`\${date} \${time}\`)`
- Added error handling for date parsing
- Simplified date display to use raw strings: `{date} at {time}`

```typescript
// Before (causing error)
interface CancellationScreenProps {
  bookingDateTime: Date; // Expected Date object
}

// After (working)
const { bookingId, businessName, service, date, time, bookingFee } =
  route.params;
const bookingDateTime = new Date(`${date} ${time}`); // Create Date from strings
```

#### 3. Error Handling Improvements

- Added try-catch blocks around date operations
- Added null checks before calling date methods
- Provided fallback text when date parsing fails

### Files Modified

1. `mobile-app/App.tsx` - Updated route parameter types
2. `mobile-app/screens/customer/BookingScreen.tsx` - Convert Date to string for navigation
3. `mobile-app/screens/customer/BookingConfirmedScreen.tsx` - Parse string back to Date
4. `mobile-app/screens/customer/CancellationScreen.tsx` - Handle string date/time parameters

### Testing Verification

‚úÖ BookingConfirmed screen now displays dates correctly
‚úÖ CancellationScreen opens without errors when clicking "Cancel"
‚úÖ All date formatting works properly throughout the app
‚úÖ No more `toLocaleDateString` undefined errors

### Prevention Measures

- All date parameters in navigation are now consistently handled as strings
- Date objects are created locally in components when needed
- Error handling added for date parsing operations
- Type definitions updated to match actual data flow

## üéØ Result

The app now works smoothly without any date-related crashes. Users can:

- Complete bookings and see proper confirmation screens
- Cancel bookings without encountering errors
- View properly formatted dates throughout the application

**Status: ‚úÖ RESOLVED - All date formatting errors fixed**
